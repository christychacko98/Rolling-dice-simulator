# Rolling-dice-simulator
It is an Rolling Dice Game where at first user has to enter his name for registration . Then you will have to guesses the number and  if you are right then you will the game. This game currently works on console base gradually I will be adding GUI Component to it. This game  is made in Python 3.x version .
Current status of project:-
Currently this project showcase the very basic version of popular  Game called Ludo  , in future this  project need more enhancement  for better .and I will try my best give Ludo a new shape and with new rules.

About ROLLING DICE program:
Dice from Old French d√©h; from Latin datum "something which is given or played are small throwable objects that can rest in multiple positions, used for generating random numbers. Dice are suitable as gambling devices for games like craps and are also used in non-gambling tabletop games. Play  media Dice being thrown in slow motion.
A traditional die is a cube, with each of its six faces showing a different number of dots (pips) from one to six. When thrown or rolled, the die comes to rest showing on its upper surface a random integer from one to six, each value being equally likely. A variety of similar devices are also described as dice; such specialized dice may have polyhedral or irregular shapes and may have faces marked with symbols instead of numbers. They may be used to produce results other than one through six. Loaded and crooked dice are designed to favor some results over others for purposes of cheating or amusement. 
A dice tray, a tray used to contain thrown dice, is sometimes used for gambling or board games, in particular to allow dice throws which do not interfere with other game pieces.

DICE PROGRAME which were built earlier:
1. c++ :  Dice program which was created in c++ using Random function which is a inbuilt function. 
2. Dice program which is created in java also using Random function which is a inbuilt function in java .
After studying pre- build programs of rolling dice I decided to create this game in python programming language .
